## Motivation

[Chrome DevTools](https://developers.google.com/chrome-developer-tools/) comes with a lot of cool stuff for those awesome devs (which are, by definition, [lazy](http://blog.codinghorror.com/how-to-be-lazy-dumb-and-successful/)).

Here comes a great quote from the link above:

> only lazy programmers will want to write the kind of tools that might replace them in the end. Only a lazy programmer will avoid writing monotonous, repetitive code.

As we, from the frontend team, didn't wan't to keep injecting code into devtools and them repeting this, we've then developed this.
